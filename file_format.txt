Pacman test files formats:

pacman_*.steps:

On first line comes pacman's data, first his position and then all the moves made in game.
template:
XX YY WASDX

for example:
15 6 WWDD
(Pacman spawns on point (15,6) and moves twice up and twice right).

Then, comes the ghosts' data, one line per ghost, only moves are written
template:
WASDX

for example:
WWXX
AADD

there will be 2 ghosts, the first moves twice up and twice down, the second one moves twice left and then twice right.

At last, comes the fruits' data, each line is made for each fruit the game spawns. (the order is first line = first fruit).
template:
XX YY FRUIT_VALUE FRUIT_LIFETIME FRUIT_CD FRUIT_INTERVAL WASDX

for example:
10 2 5 30 10 2 WWDD

one fruit will be spawned, with starting position of (10, 2), value of 5, 30 steps lifetime, 10 seconds cooldown till spawns,
moves every 2 turns, and will move twice up and twice right.


pacman_*.result:

the file contains incoming collisions with ghosts and map wins.
the order of the events is important, and it is written from first to last.
the template is:
STEPS_COUNT W/L

for example:
32 L
45 W

pacman will hit a ghost after 32 moves and then win the map after 45 moves.

XX - X Position of object on screen
YY - Y Position of object on screen
FRUIT_VALUE - value of fruit
FRUIT_LIFETIME - how long fruit is on board
FRUIT_CD - how long untill the fruit spawns
FRUIT_INTERVAL - speed of fruit (the highter the slower)
